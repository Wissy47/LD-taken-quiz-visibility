# LD-taken-quiz-visibility
This LearnDashÂ add-on plugin controls the visibility of quiz questions already taken by a student. These quiz questions are available on the Learndash student profile under the statistic section.

By default, the quiz questions are visible to students after they have taken the quiz which some instructors would not want because they want students to attempt the quiz more than once of which having access to the token quiz questions on their dashboard will encourage cheating. The LD-taken-quiz-visibility is needed to set quiz question visibility.
